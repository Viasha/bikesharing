# bikesharing
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders asked to see a bike trip analysis. To complete this analysis I used Tableau along with data produced by the NYC Citibike service. The visualizations produced during this analysis will show the investors that Des Moines is a profitable location to start a bike sharing company.

* The central area of the city has higher usage likely caused by business traffic.

## Summary
I conclude that it would be a great business venture to begin a bike sharing service in Des Moines. Based off the data produced by NYC Citibike it would be ideal for more bikes to be located in the busier areas near central and downtown. These areas have higher usage likely caused by the business commuters. Subscribers are the majority of user especially during the weekdays. In order to increase business on the weekends, I would suggest offering incentives to subcribed customers to encourage them to ride more. Making sure the bikes get returned to the high usage areas would be the biggest challenge of this service. To furter analyze this setback it would be useful to include a visualization that shows the most frequent stop locations. Having an idea of popular end points can help manage the dispurments of bikes. A second analysis that uses data from other major cities or other time frames would also assist in encouraging investors.
